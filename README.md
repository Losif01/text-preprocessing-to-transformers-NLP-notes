## Notes on NLP (all the way to transformers)
This is my personal notes i have been taking while studying the [Stanford NLP course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/), they also have it uploaded on youtube, just search "Stanford NLP" on youtube and you will find the latest upload from them
## What you will find
you will find in the notes, not just unorganized gibberish like most students do
you will see:
- theory
- code implementation for each topic
- uses cases for each topic (when to use what)
- grapic diagrams using Mermaid, if any diagram does not render here on github md viewer, use this website: [Mermaid Viewer](https://mermaid.js.org/) and past the diagram that doesn't render
- examples that are not so popular, because i am tired from NLP videos overusing the "king" and "queen" examples
- solved examples for most preprocessing algorithms, and note that you should at least solve them by hand at least 2 times with different cases

## That's it, Happy learning!
